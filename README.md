# Hey there, I'm Bruno

iOS Engineer by day, code enthusiast by night. I focus on building secure, elegant mobile applications that make a genuine impact.

## Current Focus

I'm currently creating Swift magic at [Inter](https://www.inter.co), safeguarding over 25 million users every day through:
	- Rigorous security features
	- SwiftUI-driven interfaces
	- Clean MVVM architecture
	- Leadership and mentoring

## Toolbox
	- Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit
	- MVVM, Clean Architecture
	- Security Engineering, Fraud Prevention, Liveness Detection

## Professional Journey

Over the past four years, I've delved deep into iOS development with a specialization in security and fraud prevention. Before that, I worked on apps in retail, e-commerce, and even contributed to machine learning initiatives. My core belief is that code should be both secure and visually appealingâ€”there's no reason to compromise on either.
