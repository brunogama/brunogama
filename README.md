# 👋 Hey there, I'm Bruno!

iOS Engineer by day, code enthusiast by night. I'm passionate about building secure, beautiful mobile experiences that make a difference.

## 💻 What I'm up to

Currently cooking up Swift magic at Inter, where I help protect over 25 million users daily. I'm all about:

- 🔐 Building rock-solid security features
- 📱 Crafting slick SwiftUI interfaces
- 🏗️ Architecting with MVVM
- 👥 Leading awesome teams

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

Swift | SwiftUI | UIKit | MVVM | Security Engineering | Fraud Prevention | Liveness Detection

## 🚀 My Journey

I've spent the last 4+ years deep in the iOS world, with a special focus on security and fraud prevention. Before that, I built apps across all sorts of industries from retail to e-commerce and even dabbled in some machine learning projects.

I believe great code should be both secure AND beautiful - why choose when you can have both? I'm always exploring better ways to build things and love sharing what I learn along the way.
